## Conclusion

Now that you have completed the lab, let's review what was covered here:

* Explored Baremetal Operator and added a kubernetes node with it.
* Deploy a kubevirt vm and an app on top, using ceph through rook for storage in a transparent way.
* Migrate this app to a version based on container and using crds

All those objects share one thing in common, they are native to kubernetes so you use the same tooling to interact with them!
