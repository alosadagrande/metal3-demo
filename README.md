# Deploy and Explore Metal3 operator and Friends

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the baremetal operator and related components to provide a native user experience in Kubernetes

## Rationale

Metal3 project aims to easily provision kubernetes on baremetal.

This lab tries to demonstrate how the following components can be used together to build complex applications native to Kubernetes.

- kubernetes
- baremetal operator along with ironic
- kubevirt
- rook
- metallb

We then showcase how we can use it as a common ground for virtualization and storage solution on top.

This lab doesn't require previous Metal3 experience.
